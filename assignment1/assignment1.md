Question: Why was it initially hard to track for Vuforia and why did your features improve it? Why was it not necessary for some of the targets?

* ***Answer:** The images where lacking good features like edges and corners. **Vuforia** (as well as other Computer Vision libraries e.g. OpenCV) are more capable of detecting edges and corners e.g. using Harris detectors. We strected the contrast an added rectangular objects.*
